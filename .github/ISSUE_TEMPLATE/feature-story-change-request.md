**if story/mechanic based. can this be done in gb studio or does it have to wait for the pc/modern system remake**
explain why it can or can't be done
is this feature for mature audiences if yes put mature audiences in the title
**is this story based, race based, or mechanic based**
after this give a description of the idea
**if this is story based**
this is to add an/multiple story element/s to the game.
does this element effect the main story or is this a side quest that does not do much?
what copyright issues might be involved (you have a higher chance of getting it accepted [although unlikely] if you are upfront with this as I will do research on this)? and who should I talk to about adding this?
where do I add this element to the story?
why should I add this?

**if this is mechanic based**
this is to add an action/menu to the game
can this be added in gb studio?
what are the requirements needed?
an estimate on what needs to be changed to add.
can you give any assets for this?
any demos or mods that can be shown of the mechanic?
why should I add this?

**if this is race based**
this is to add a race/character to the story.
if adding a character they cannot be one with story elements attached. and replace race with character below.
is this race copyrighted? if so, who might I contact to potentially add? (similar story with story-based features to add)
what are the physical features available?
what are the general magical stats of the race?
what are the general height and weight of the race?
any general racial hostilities or stereotypes of the race?
what is the general naming pattern/s? ex: canine and feline races generally are natural objects to do with the ground/nature.
are there multiple forms of the race available?
what is the general (biological) sexual dimorphism if any that differs from humans? ex: males have a stronger tail.
what is the culture and religion of the race? 
what is the average age limit for the race? would the solar council need to adjust the adult age for this race (which is 21 years)? ex: humans are 18 years.
what are the special abilities of the race that are not magical? ex: flight
what is the race's diet composed of?
what is the average intelligence of the race?
what are notable characters and history of the race? feel free to make up characters and try not to contradict the story already put in place.
any links to lookup the race such as a wiki.
